# Scheduled-Post-Planner
The Scheduled Post Planner creates a meta box on your post page sidebar which displays your upcoming (3) scheduled posts. It shows your "latest" (furthest away) scheduled posts so that you can effectively plan what date you should schedule next. I always found that as I was planning my scheduled posts I was continually needing to save my draft, go to the all posts list to see what was the last or "latest" scheduled post and then go back to my saved draft and proceed with scheduling my next post. This plugin removes that step and easily shows you the title and date with month of the latest (furthest away) scheduled posts. In addition to the list of 3 posts is a "view all" button which redirects you to a list of only scheduled posts and an icon that displays your total number of scheduled posts to help planning ahead.
